# Reinforcement-Learning

## Summary

This repository contains two examples of using reinforcement learning to train agents to learn their environments. Both use different types
of Q-Learning. The Mountain Car example uses traditional Q-Learning to update a table to learn the Mountain Car environment from OpenAI. The
effects of different hyperparameters are explored by their variation. The second example uses DDQN via convolution to learn how to play Ms.
Pac-Man with screen images.
